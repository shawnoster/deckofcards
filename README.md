# deckofcards

This is a Weekend Fun Project, basically a personal hack-a-thon to see how fast I can cobble together a quick API. I'm starting with the [Deck of Cards API] because it's fun, it's already designed, and fairly simply in it's operations.

## Goals

- Do something fun
- Can I hook up Azure DevOps to notify me (personally) of changes?
- How well does Postman work with .NET C#?
- Hook up Azure DevOps to home-assistant.io to flash my Hue Go on build break
- Hook up Azure DevOps to DuckyAPI to light up my keyboard on a build break

## Questions

  - Can we use VWAC ADO resources for personal learnings like this?
  - Can I expense the account even though it's under my personal e-mail?

## "Live" Progress

(_live stream, clean up later, focus Shawn_)

- porting the [Deck of Cards API] to .NET Core 3.1 (or 5, I haven't decided).
   - I like cards
   - already has a well defined API
- started w/ Postman but didn't like the "blank slate" start
- switched to stoplight.io, seems to have similar features
- upgraded to $99/mo to try out Azure DevOps integration
- I should import DoC OpenAPI to better model VWAC but that's less fun on a Sat.
- forget trying for ADO, requires $399 pro plan
  - good reason to switch to Github vs. ADO for source control?
- need to figure out how to pull the OpenAPI spec file for importing üê±‚Äçüèç
- need to pull VWAC OpenAPI spec files and make sure they're valid

## Design Decisions

Why did I do that?

   - start with a stock C# web API or jump right to Functions?
     - Functions because I have less experience with them
   - ADO or Github?
     -  ADO so it's applicable to my M-F

## Distractions

Things for me to watch out for that defocus my time.

   - is it defocus on unfocus?
   - spent 10min trying to once again redo how I organize my notes, stop it
   - spent 10min browsing themes in sublime then remembered I prefer vscode
   - swapped Consoles for Cascadia Code, is it better?
   - started Firefly
   - spent 10min reorganizing this damn file
   - make that 15min

## Learned

  - Do the Postman "Designing and mocking APIs" lessons, simple and quick
  - Register for [Postman 101 for Developers]
